## Installation: 
 Clone the repo, and run 'npm init', 'npm install mysql2'. Copy the 'employeeSchemma' text into a mysql workbench file, execute the script.  

## Usage: 
 Run 'node index.js' to start application. In order to use this application the user will need to use the schema and seeds to get starting data into the database. Then in order to follow the application's logic, add a new department FIRST > THEN a add role > THEN add an employee. User can't add an employee without a role or manager for the employee. User can't add a role without a department for the role. REMOVING a role will remove the employee attached to that role. REMOVING a department will remove all data/employees/roles contained within.
